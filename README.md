## Impact

By implementing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, I improved the quality and accuracy of responses generated from large language models (LLMs). By retrieving relevant documents or data, RAG models generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses, reducing the chances of incorrect or nonsensical information. Additionally, RAG systems can dynamically update knowledge, quickly adapting to new information without retraining the entire model, making them more flexible and responsive to changes in the information landscape.
